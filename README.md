# SimpleChat
A simple chat that is made using ASP.NET WebAPI, SignalrR, AngularJS, Bootstrap, SQL Server.

This is just a pet project. The purpose of making this project is just that I want to learn more about these technologies above. 
The front-end web is currently being written using AngularJS, but in the future, I will change to React. I don't know much about React, so I'm temporary using AngularJS to make the front end, but in the future, React will be used.
